#  Homework 3

Make a 2D scene with two rectangles on top of a square. The rectangles are on the upper left and upper right part of the square. (3 points)

The rectangles are continually spinning (use Idle function in GLUT). (2 points)

The user can left-click on the square and move it around. The rectangles move with the square. (2 points)

The user can right-click on the square and scale it. While holding the right button down, if the mouse goes away from the center of the square, expand the square proportionally, and vice versa. Rectangles scale proportionally with the square. (3 points)

Bonus: Right-click also can rotate the square. Rectangles rotate with the square. (1 point)

Bonus: User enters ‘m’ to toggle between 2D mode and 3D mode. In 3D mode, show the square as a block and the rectangles as spinning blocks on top of the square block. Transformations (translate, rotate, scale) in 2D scene cause same transformations in 3D. Make sure the scene is lighted. (1 point)
